    <h2>Air Fryer Scrambled Eggs On The Go</h2>
    <p>
      This simple air fryer eggs on the go recipe allows you to have a warm
      protein-packed meal to kick-start your day while your coffee is brewing. I
      like to place 2 fully cooked turkey sausage links in the basket alongside
      the ramekin for an added boost of energy.
